# vmware-fusion-bootcamp

Sometimes VMWare Fusion says it cannot find your Boot Camp partition, even though the partition does exist and you can boot into it when starting your Mac.

Using this script should let you create a Boot Camp VM.

## Instructions

1. Download this repository
2. Run `fusion-make-bootcamp` in a terminal
3. There should now be a Boot Camp VM on your desktop
